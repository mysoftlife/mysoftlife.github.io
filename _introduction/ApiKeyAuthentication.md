  #### Making a request
  
  All REST requests must contain the following headers:
  
  `ACCESS-KEY` API key as a string
  
  `SIGNATURE` Message signature (see below)
  
  `TIMESTAMP` Timestamp for your request
  
  
  
  The `SIGNATURE` header is generated by creating a sha256 HMAC using the secret key on the prehash string `timestamp + method + requestPath + body` (where + represents string concatenation). The timestamp value is the same as the `TIMESTAMP` header.
  
  The `body` is the request body string. It is omitted if there is no request body (typically for GET requests).
  
  The `method` should be UPPER CASE.
  
  The `requestPath` is the full path and query parameters of the URL, e.g.: `/v1.0/markets/symbols?coin_symbol=ETH`.
  
  The `TIMESTAMP` header MUST be number of seconds since [Unix Epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) in UTC.
  
  Your timestamp must be within 60 seconds of the API service time, or your request will be considered expired and rejected.
